# FastFurniture
Application was developed to assist a few friends who just started a new business. This application is purely for the client to update their inventory for their furniture business. Considering there are only two employees and paid help here. The work was time consuming and tedious at points so I identified some issues and developed an application with a fellow Zip Coder to automate their inventory. With our help and creative approach we hope to lend a hand to a small business in the middle of a pandemic.
